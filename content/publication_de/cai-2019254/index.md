abstract: The strong dependence between cortical bone elasticity at the millimetre-scale
  (mesoscale) and cortical porosity has been evidenced by previous studies. However,
  bone is an anisotropic composite material made by mineral, proteins and water assembled
  in a hierarchical structure. Whether the variations of structural and compositional
  properties of bone affect the different elastic coefficients at the mesoscale is
  not clear. Aiming to understand the relationships between bone elastic properties
  and compositions and microstructure, we applied state-of-the-art experimental modalities
  to assess these aspects of bone characteristics. All elastic coefficients (stiffness
  tensor of the transverse isotropic bone material), structure of the vascular pore
  network, collagen and mineral properties were measured in 52 specimens from the
  femoral diaphysis of 26 elderly donors. Statistical analyses and micromechanical
  modeling showed that vascular pore volume fraction and the degree of mineralization
  of bone are the most important determinants of cortical bone anisotropic mesoscopic
  elasticity. Though significant correlations were observed between collagen properties
  and elasticity, their effects in bone mesoscopic elasticity were minor in our data.
  This work also provides a unique set of data exhibiting a range of variations of
  compositional and microstructural cortical bone properties in the elderly and gives
  strong experimental evidence and basis for further development of biomechanical
  models for human cortical bone. Statement of Significance This study reports the
  relationships between microstructure, composition and the mesoscale anisotropic
  elastic properties of human femoral cortical bone in elderly. For the first time,
  we provide data covering the complete anisotropic elastic tensor, the microstructure
  of cortical vascular porosity, mineral and collagen characteristics obtained from
  the same or adjacent samples in each donor. The results revealed that cortical vascular
  porosity and degree of mineralization of bone are the most important determinants
  of bone anisotropic stiffness at the mesoscale. The presented data gives strong
  experimental evidence and basis for further development of biomechanical models
  for human cortical bone.
