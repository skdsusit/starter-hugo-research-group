abstract: Elasticity assessment based on bulk wave velocity (BWV) measurements is
  the most popular technique to characterize the anisotropic stiffness tensor in cortical
  bone. Typically, a cuboid bone specimen is cut with its sides along the different
  anatomical directions. Then, the velocity of shear and longitudinal waves propagating
  along different directions are assessed, from which stiffness coefficients are calculated.
  Despite the importance of obtaining accurate elasticity values for bone research,
  there is no generally accepted protocol to measure BWV and the precision of the
  technique has been seldom investigated. The purpose of this work is to critically
  assess the method to measure BWV on cuboid specimens in terms of ultrasound frequency,
  specimen size and signal processing technique. In this study, we measured polycarbonate
  specimens of different dimensions and 55 human bone specimens with different transducers
  using frequencies ranging from 2.25 to 10MHz and 1â€“5MHz for longitudinal and shear
  waves, respectively. We compared four signal processing methods to detect the wave
  arrival time. The main results are that, (1) the measurement of shear waves is more
  complex than that of longitudinal wave, being less precise and more sensitive to
  sample size; (2) the estimated stiffness depends on the signal processing technique
  used (up to 10% variation for shear coefficients of bone); and (3) bone stiffness
  assessed from BWV using the first arrival of the signal to determine the time-of-flight
  is not different from stiffness assessed using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy
  (RUS). These results evidence that the measurement method can have an effect on
  the stiffness values estimates and hence, a well-defined protocol is needed to accurately
  measure bone stiffness coefficients based on BWV.
