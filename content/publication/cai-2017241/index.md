abstract: In the study of mechanical properties of human bone, specimens may be defatted
  before experiments to prevent contamination and the risk of infections. High energy
  synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-μCT) is a popular technique
  to study bone microstructure. However, little is known about the effects of defatting
  or irradiation during SR-μCT imaging on different elastic coefficients including
  shear and longitudinal moduli in different anatomical directions. In this work,
  these effects are evaluated on a set of 24 samples using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy
  (RUS), which allows one to accurately measure the complete set of elastic coefficients
  of cortical bone non destructively. The results show that defatting with diethylether
  and methanol and irradiation up to 2.5kGy has no detectable effect on any of the
  elastic coefficients of human cortical bone.
